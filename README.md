python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
```
After creating the virtual environment acrtivate it and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd /path/to/virtual/environment
source bin/activate
```
Once the virtual environment is activated you can use `pip3` to install the dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
